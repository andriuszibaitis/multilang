Sainte-Foy-Tarentaise is a commune in the Savoie department in the Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes region in south-eastern France.

The mountain has four chairlifts and two magic carpets for beginners. There is a vertical drop of just over 1000 m from the highest point at the Col de l'Aiguille (2620 m). There are around 20 pistes, with a choice for all ability levels. A green trail snakes through the trees back down to the resort while the new Grande Soliet run down from the Marquise chairlift offers a long, wide, swooping blue-grade trail. Red runs vary from the roller-coaster of Les Creux de Formeian to tight, steep challenges. There is one groomed black run but another three marked off-piste areas, also graded black.

While the on-piste skiing is excellent for beginners and confirmed skiers, the resort is also known for the off-piste terrain. This varies from short runs between the trails to legendary descents such as the easy tour to the village of Le Monal or the fearsome north face of La Fogliettaz.

The ski resort sits high above the village at 1550m above sea level. The resort was built in an old farming hamlet, some of which survives as chalet accommodation. Most of the village has been built recently, but in a sympathetic style using wood and stone. There are luxury apartments and chalets. There are two spas in the resort, both with swimming pools, jacuzzis, and saunas, as well as massage and beauty treatments. There are five ski shops, two bars, three restaurants and a small supermarket.
